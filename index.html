        <h1>Jack</h1>
        <p>My name is Jack - well, my real name is John, but I've gone by Jack since birth as a nickname. I have taken multiple coding classes throughout college, so this is not my first web page. However, I learn new skills with every class, and this class has taught me about several aspects of coding I didn't previously know about, as well as a whole lot of info on dealing with images and using programs like Photoshop.</p>

        <p>This is a picture of an Octocat - a cat that has tentacles instead of paws. Generally, Octocats have eight tentacles, however, only five are shown in this photo (the rest obscured by her front tentacles.</p>
