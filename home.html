      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Jack Connolly, and I have dreamt of working in the music industry since I was a young boy. This website serves as a portfolio in the music-related work I've done so far, primarily "Alternative Trap" - a radio show that I have been building into a full on brand, complete with representation and content across many different media platforms.</p>

      <p>I have been heavily invested in the music business through the internet since I was in middle school, writing reviews and blog posts and exploring the deep depths of internet music archives. However, being from New Hampshire, it wasn't until I transferred to the University of Miami that I found hands-on experience working in the business. As soon as I enrolled my sophomore year, I immediately found and joined all the music-related extracurricular clubs and activities I could find.
        Two in particular, WVUM 90.5 The Voice and HP Concerts, have been especially helpful in giving me useful experience and knowledge. Throughout my college years in each of these organizations, I have learned how to organize, book and promote concerts and festivals, run radio shows, effectively interview and interact with artists, and so many nuances that come with the business. I have risen to positions of authority, including the executive board positions Social Media Director and PR/Promotions Director for WVUM 90.5, for which I lead a staff of 20+ other students interested in working in the music business. Across this website, I have outlined my experience in depth and included many links to and examples of my work.</p>
